# Harry Potter the Magic World 
![harry-potter](data/harry-potter.jpg)
## Introduction

This is a simple *Harry Potter* theme turn-based role-playing video game. I named it *Harry Potter the Magic World*. 
Players can choose their favourite wizard to fight against evil enemies by choosing a spell to in each round. Different 
spells have different ATK\(attack) to the enemy, and if the HP\(health point) of a character less than or equals to 
zero, then the character dies. Each wizard and enemy also has unique HP and ATK from others, so the difficulty of each 
battle is distinct. Moreover, there is a simple plot of the game to make sure it is not boring. To be specific, 
the enemies the player will encounter will get stronger and stronger, and the player must beat previous ones to fight 
against the next enemy. However, the player's attacking point is also getting larger and larger after each battle.
Everyone who is interested in *Harry Potter* can enjoy this game. This game can be expanded by 
adding more battles and more attracting plot, as well as different mode and more elements like shopping system can be 
added in the future maintenance. I picked this project because I am into playing video games and both of *Harry Potter* 
series books and movies attract me a lot. This is a demo version, so there are only three battles. However, it is not hard
and complicated to add more and more.
